Instructions: 
First, run featurize.py to get the features that will later be used for the spam dataset.
Then, run all the cells in hw1.ipynb in order.
The results will show up once the cell finishes running. Note that some cells may throw a ConvergenceWarning, though this shouldn't impact performance.
Also, the final CIFAR10 predictions cell may run very slowly, since I decided to train the classifier on all the data.
